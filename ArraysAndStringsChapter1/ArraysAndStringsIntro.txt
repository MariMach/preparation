Array
Worst case
    Lookup O(1)
    Lookup by value O(n)
    Insert O(n)
    Delete O(n)
Best case
    Lookup by index O(1)
    Lookup by value O(1)
    Insert O(n)
    Delete O(1)
int[] numbers = new int[6]; 
Arrays.toString(numbers)

create a dynamic array in Array.class
dynamic array from scratch
java built in Arraylist and vector
vector grows by 100%, vector is synchronized (just one thread can access its elemnt)
arraylist grows by 50% : 
        add(i), remove(i), contains(i), size(), indexOf(i), lastIndexOf(i), toArray().

1- Extend the Array class and add a new method to return the largest
number. What is the runtime complexity of this method?
Solution: Array.max()

2- Extend the Array class and add a method to return the common items
in this array and another array.
Solution: Array.intersect()

3- Extend the Array class and add a method to reverse the array. For
example, if the array includes [1, 2, 3, 4], after reversing and printing it,
we should see [4, 3, 2, 1].
Solution: Array.reverse()

4- Extend the Array class and add a new method to insert an item at a
given index:
public void insertAt(int item, int index)
Solution: Array.insertAt()
