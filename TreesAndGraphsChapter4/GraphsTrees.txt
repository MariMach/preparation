Graph :
Cyclic or Acyclic
Weighthed or Unweighted 
Directed or Undirected

Shortest Paths : 
Bellman 
Dijkstra


Graph Traversal && Tree Traversal: O(n)
Breadth first dearch
Depth first search
Inorder
Postorder
Preorder
Recursion (be mindful of Space Complexity (Stack overflow))

Tree : 
- Used to represent hierarchical data.
- Databases (indexing).
- Autocompletion.
- Compilers.
- Compression.

A data structure that stores elements in a hierarchy 
those elements are nodea and the elements that connect them are edges.
Each node contains a value or data object.
The root is the parrent of the nodes.
the nodes on the bottom are leaf nodes.

Binary Tree : each node has two children.
lookup O(log n)
insert O(log n)
delete O(log n)
better than arrays and linked lists

Binary Search Tree : easly look up the data, the value left < node < right.
Balanced BST lookup O(log n)
             insert O(log n)
             delete O(log n)
AVL Tree
Red Black Tree 
Heap 
Trie
Binary Heap lookup O(n)
            insert O(log n)
            delete O(log n)
Priority Queue
