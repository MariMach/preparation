Linked List => to store a list of objects in sequence 
but unlike arrays linked lists can grow and shrink automatically, consists of a chain of nodes
each node holds two pieces of data the value ond the address of the next node.

Singly Linked List
Doubly Linked List

lookup by value O(n)
lookup by index O(n)

insert at the end O(1) tail append O(1)
insert at the beginning O(1) head prepend O(1)
insert in the middle O(n) 

delete from the beginning O(1)
delete from the end O(n)
delete from the middle O(n) 

linked lists in java :java.util LinkedList<String>
LinkedList list = new LinkedList();
list.addLast(10);
list.addLast(20);
list.addLast(30);
list.addFirst(5);
System.out.println(list.contains(10));
System.out.println(list.indexOf(10)); // returns the index of the first occurrence
System.out.println(list);
System.out.println(list.size());
int[] arr = list.toArray();
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
