stores key value pairs
key => hash function => address to store the value
hash tables are deterministic 

space O(n)
insert O(1)
lokkup O(1)
delete O(1)

could be O(n) with hash collisions  and dynamic array resizing but unlikely.

Improved time complexity ? fast Access O(1), tradeoff : more memory O(n)
Collision ? Linked List

HashTables used in : 
- Spell checkers
- Dictionaries
- Compilers
- Code editors

HashTables in java :
Map interface
HashMap
HashTable
TreeMap
