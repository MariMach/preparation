/* 
1- Find the most repeated element in an array of integers. What is the
time complexity of this method? (A variation of this exercise is finding
the most repeated word in a sentence. The algorithm is the same. Here
we use an array of numbers for simplicity.)
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
Output: 3
